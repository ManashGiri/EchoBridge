## 📌 About EcoBridge

*EcoBridge* is a full-stack web application built for the DigiGreen National Hackathon. It connects users who want to donate usable waste (like electronics, utensils, furniture) with nearby NGOs, recyclers, or upcyclers using real-time geolocation and smart matching.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Industrialization and consumerism lead to growing e-waste, plastic pollution, and resource wastage. Usable items are often discarded, while NGOs and organizations lack access to affordable usable materials.

EcoBridge creates a hyperlocal platform that:

* Allows users to upload images and details of reusable waste.
* Matches these donations with nearby NGOs/recyclers.
* Notifies both parties and tracks the impact.
* Rewards users with EcoPoints for contributions.
